TODO:

Future tasks to do(Future guy/gal or again Alan):
------------
-add more microplastics to reference database
-correction for match overlap? Seems the reference has an offset
-github large file problem (database)
-improve matching algorithm: consider missing peaks outside of reference range
-Superimposed plots: Implement a Neural Network to predict multiple matches


-The algorithm to identify the microplastics from the pics in the spectrum of the sample should be reviewed. For now Gaussian-weighted algorithm was used,
but whether this choice is relevant must be confirmed.
-If multiple microplastics are present in the sample, the Raman struggles
analyzing them.




the frontend dropdowns should stazy activated when the thing is selected. not onChange.


after uploading, keep the sample ?




buy a new Pi for faster connection ?


ask francesco and louis. We are wanting to switch to 5 for faster connection. we saw that you tried 4,  would there be any other problem ?

communicate photoncamera-raspberry pi using other connector ?
or using another photon camera ? with better bandwidth 


make button to add recent sample to database
